mimiQ++

A lightweight quantum computing simulation library

Originally started as a hobby project, mimiQ++ is now evolving into an educational platform for students to learn, explore, and contribute to quantum computing and systems programming.

We're building a smooth onboarding experience to help beginners dive into:

    Fundamental quantum computing concepts

    C and C++ programming

    Git and open-source workflows

All organized in a clear roadmap designed for minimal prior experience.

All it takes is your time and curiosity. If you're here to learn and grow, you're exactly who this project is for.

Already an expert? Maybe let the newbies shine on this one ðŸ˜‰
