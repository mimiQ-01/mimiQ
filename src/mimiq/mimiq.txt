// a qbit as from our understanding can be represented as a sphere will 3 angles
// which correspond to the rotations from reference axes x,y,z in this project,
// a qbit is represented in the form of a|0> + b|1> the reason is for its
// simplicity and ease to manipulate it mathematically a is called the real
// part, and b is called the complex part (b is imaginary part where a,b
// together is called complex number, but bare with the naming sense lol)

// prime basis state_: |0> , |1>
// for other basis sets: {|+>, |->}, {|i>, |-i>}, spontaneous computation is
// done as they are not often used

// default constructors
